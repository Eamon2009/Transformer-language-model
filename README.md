## What This Project Does

This project trains a small GPT-style transformer model on children's stories and then generates new story-like text character by character. It is a learning project — the goal is not to produce publishable stories, but to understand how language models learn patterns from text and to see that process happen live on your own machine and cloud GPU.

---

## How It Works

The model is a **character-level transformer**. This means:

- It reads your text file one character at a time
- It learns which characters tend to follow other characters in which contexts
- At generation time it predicts the next character, then the next, then the next — forever

It is the same core architecture as GPT, just much smaller and trained on much less data.

**The pipeline in order:**

```
data.txt  (children's stories)
    ↓
Characters encoded as integers (vocab size varies by run)
    ↓
Model trains on sequences of tokens at a time
    ↓
Every N steps: loss is measured and printed
    ↓
Best weights saved to best_model.pt whenever val loss improves
    ↓
After training: text generation begins
    ↓
Press Ctrl+C to stop
```

---

## Setup & Requirements

**Python version:** 3.8 or higher

**Install dependencies:**

```bash
pip install torch
```

No other dependencies needed. The project uses only PyTorch and Python standard library modules.

---

## How to Run

```bash
python transformer.py
```

The script will:

1. Print a startup banner with device and timestamp
2. Load and report stats on your dataset
3. Build the model and print parameter count
4. Train for the configured number of steps, printing progress at each eval interval
5. Save best weights to `best_model.pt` automatically
6. Start text generation when done

> **Key insight on Run 3:** A 1.99M parameter model on a Tesla T4 reached val loss 0.9250 in just 6.1 minutes — faster than any previous run by a large margin. This shows GPU acceleration pays off even for small models. Run 2 still holds the best quality due to its larger size and more data, but Run 3 shows what efficient GPU use looks like.

## Model Output Comparison

### Run 2 — GPU (10.82M params, val loss 0.7176)

```
Upon a time, there were two friends, Jack and Tom. They had a cold doll in
the sunshine.

One day, Jack saw that he was universed. He used the sky at past it to march
around the garden. He had a small ball on his face. He felt dizzy and wanted
to share his happy with them.

Nack knew it was feeling important to his passion in their rooms. He knew
that night, he had never seen a small boy just soon could drink.

He kept helping her passion and seing this boy. As he kept walking, he saw
a girl.

|---|---|---|---|
| **Sentence structure** | Fragmented | Full sentences | Partial sentences |
| **Story arc** | Weak | Clear narrative flow | Basic flow |
| **Character names** | Inconsistent | Consistent | Moderate |
| **Spelling** | Many errors | Mostly correct | Mostly correct |
| **Word spacing** | Mostly correct | Correct | Correct |
| **Coherence** | Low | Moderate | Low-moderate |

## Loss Curve Analysis

All three runs showed the same characteristic loss curve shape:

```
Phase 1 — Rapid Drop (0–20% of training):
  Run 1 (CPU):     3.30 → 1.70   (model learns basic structure fast)
  Run 2 (Colab):   4.92 → 1.03   (steeper — larger model, more to learn)
  Run 3 (T4):      4.62 → 1.25   (fast drop in just seconds on GPU)

Phase 2 — Steady Descent (20–80%):
  Run 1:   1.70 → 1.39
  Run 2:   1.03 → 0.74
  Run 3:   1.25 → 0.96   (consistent improvement throughout)

Phase 3 — Diminishing Returns (80–100%):
  Run 1:   1.39 → 1.31
  Run 2:   0.74 → 0.72
  Run 3:   0.96 → 0.93   (still falling — more steps would help)
```

All three models were **still improving at the final checkpoint**. None hit a plateau. This means more training steps would reduce loss further in every run.

---

## Overfitting Analysis

**No run showed any overfitting.**

In all three cases, val loss tracked train loss closely and improved monotonically across most checkpoints.

```
Healthy training (all runs):
  train loss ↓ and val loss ↓ together  →  model is generalizing

Overfitting would look like:
  train loss ↓ but val loss ↑           →  model is memorizing
```

The train/val gap at the end of each run:

| Run | Final Train | Final Val | Gap |
|---|---|---|---|
| Run 1 (CPU, 0.82M) | 1.3191 | 1.3145 | 0.0046 |
| Run 2 (Colab, 10.82M) | 0.7259 | 0.7176 | 0.0083 |
| Run 3 (T4, 1.99M) | 0.9307 | 0.9250 | 0.0057 |

All gaps are small and healthy. Run 3 sits between Run 1 and Run 2, which matches its middle-sized architecture.

## Scaling Laws — And Where Your Model Sits

<img width="1029" height="705" alt="Screenshot 2026-03-17 171921" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/69b2c840-14f2-4cd1-b4b4-662abda569ff" />

### What Are Scaling Laws?

Scaling laws describe a predictable relationship between model size, dataset size, compute, and output quality:

> The more parameters, the more data, and the more compute you use — the better the model gets. And this follows a consistent, measurable curve.

The key finding (Chinchilla, 2022) is that the optimal ratio is roughly **20 tokens of training data per parameter.**

### The Three Axes of Scaling

```
Parameters (N)  →  How much the model can remember
Data (D)        →  How much it has learned from
Compute (C)     →  Parameters × Data × Training steps
```

### Where All Three Runs Sit

| Model | Parameters | Training Data | Optimal Data (20× rule) | Data Coverage |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Run 1 — CPU | 0.82M | ~200K tokens | ~16.4M tokens | **1.2%** |
| Run 3 — T4 | 1.99M | ~28.3M tokens | ~39.8M tokens | **71.1%** |
| Run 2 — Colab | 10.82M | ~79.6M tokens | ~216M tokens | **36.8%** |
| GPT-2 Small | 117M | ~40B tokens | ~2.3B tokens | ~1700% |
| GPT-3 | 175B | ~600B tokens | ~3.5T tokens | ~17% |

> **Run 3 stands out here.** At 71.1% of optimal data coverage it is the best-balanced run so far — the model size and dataset size are close to the ideal Chinchilla ratio. Run 2 has the most parameters but sits at only 36.8% coverage, meaning it would benefit more from additional data than additional capacity.

Model                    Parameters    Data               Val Loss    Output Quality
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Run 1 — CPU (this repo)  0.82M         ~200K tokens       1.3145      Word fragments
Run 3 — T4  (this repo)  1.99M         ~28.3M tokens      0.9250      Basic sentences  ← Efficient run
Run 2 — Colab (this repo)10.82M        ~79.6M tokens      0.7176      Story sentences  ← Best quality
GPT-2 Small              117M          ~40B tokens        ~3.0*       Coherent English
GPT-2 Large              774M          ~40B tokens        ~2.5*       Strong English
GPT-3                    175B          ~600B tokens       —           Near-human text

* GPT-2 losses are on a different (larger) vocabulary and not directly comparable.
```

### What This Tells Us

Run 3 proves that a small, well-balanced model on a fast GPU can converge in minutes. The next logical steps across any run:

```
1. More training steps  →  all three were still falling at the final checkpoint
2. More data            →  Run 3 is closest to optimal ratio; Run 2 benefits most
3. Larger model         →  only worth it once data coverage is above 50%
```

## How Weights Produce Output

After training, the model is frozen. The weights file (`best_model.pt`) contains all the numbers that encode everything the model learned from your children's stories.

**The generation loop:**

```
Step 1 — Start with a seed token (start of text)
              ↓
Step 2 — Feed it through all transformer layers
         Each layer does matrix multiplications
         using the saved weight numbers
              ↓
Step 3 — Output is N numbers (one per vocab character)
         Each number = probability of that character being next
         e.g.  'e' = 0.18   't' = 0.14   'a' = 0.12
              ↓
Step 4 — Sample randomly from those probabilities
              ↓
Step 5 — That character becomes the new input
         Go back to Step 2
              ↓
Step 6 — Repeat forever
```

**Why output is different every run:**

The sampling step picks randomly from the probabilities. Same weights, different random draws = different output each time. To get deterministic output, add `torch.manual_seed(42)` before generation.

## Known Limitations

- **Character-level only** — the model learns characters not words, so it cannot spell reliably or track meaning across sentences
- **Output will not be fully coherent** — story fragments are recognizable in Run 2 but still logically drift across paragraphs
- **All models undertrained** — val loss was still falling at the final checkpoint in all three runs; more iterations would help
- **Run 2 still at ~37% optimal data** — a larger story dataset would meaningfully improve output quality
- **No memory between runs** — each generation starts from scratch with no prior context

## Real Model Output (Run 1 — CPU)

```

```

## Real Model Output (Run 2 — GPU Colab)

```
Upon a time, there were two friends, Jack and Tom. They had a cold doll in
the sunshine.

One day, Jack saw that he was universed. He used the sky at past it to march
around the garden. He had a small ball on his face. He felt dizzy and wanted
to share his happy with them.

Nack knew it was feeling important to his passion in their rooms. He knew
that night, he had never seen a small boy just soon could drink.

```
## Real Model Output (Run 3 — GPU )

```
Timmy and elsed him to tell being jumping things. They were tired and making some pinkets and help paper me. They had to see them, drain and ran ar her mommy. They also fast with the stretch and sacks the changer. They play and them together or day. They tlike to need to stay and cut fun and have to catch him. But the bird is pretty. You have to make your legs and it's some people truck in it."

Lily's truck laughed and saw a rock. She said, "You can't here some wet sicks. You have something new favorite toys, I do yours. All of fun!" From that day on, Lily always callimbed the slide, and Tom were playing with the surprise, loved to play in the park. One day, they went to the park with most in the  bathting to girl and dinner. One day, the family went off another floor and quickly made Jack the toys far away. 

In a weath came and dancelet every day out for righting. It was a lot of big ball towers and eggs and make him lots of them. The man is a perfect of the bad lettersser on him.
